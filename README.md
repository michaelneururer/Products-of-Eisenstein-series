products-of-eisenstein-series
===========

Sage implementation of Eisenstein series and algorithm to compute Fourier expansions of modular forms at cusps.
Based on the article 'Products of Eisenstein series and Fourier expansions of modular forms at cusps' by Martin Dickson and Michalis Neururer.

The formulas used for the Fourier expansions of Eisenstein series are due to J. R. Weisinger 'Some results on classical Eisenstein series and modular forms over function fields' (these contain a few errors though) and unpublished notes of Henri Cohen.
