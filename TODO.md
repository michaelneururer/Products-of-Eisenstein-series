1. At the moment the program has only been tested on modular forms with rational Fourier coefficients.
2. If f is a newform and we compute the Fourier expansion of f at a cusp c, it would be good to work out in advance what field the Fourier coefficients will be in. At the moment the calculations are done in a number field that is usually bigger than the end result.
